# esp8266-rolly
This is an MQTT based Messaging system that displays the message on an 11x44 led grid

## Why the name?
The software was designed around an 11x44 individually addressable flexible LED matrix.  The idea was to place this at a location and when a message was needed to be delivered (liek the garage door is still open, etc) it could be viewed from all angles.  This led matrix was wrapped around a 3-d printed ring with ends on it.  Someone called it a rolly polly and the name rolly just stuck.
